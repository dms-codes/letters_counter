# Letter Frequency Analyzer

This Python script analyzes the frequency of letters in a given text and returns the top three most frequently occurring letters.

## Usage

1. Replace the `words` variable with the text you want to analyze.

   ```python
   words = "The little red fox jumped over a fence and bit a python"
   ```

2. Run the script.

3. The script will process the text and create a dictionary (`res`) to store the frequency of each letter (case-insensitive).

4. It then sorts the dictionary items by frequency in descending order and returns the top three most frequently occurring letters along with their frequencies.

5. The result will be displayed in the console.

6. You can adjust the input text in the `words` variable to analyze the letter frequency of different texts.

## Example

For the given input text:
```
The little red fox jumped over a fence and bit a python
```

The script will output the top three most frequently occurring letters and their frequencies:
```
[('e', 7), ('t', 5), ('o', 4)]
```
